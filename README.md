# Vehicle-Speed-Estimation-YOLOv8

This project demonstrates a vehicle detection, tracking, and speed estimation system built with YOLOv8 and OpenCV in Google Colab.
The model detects and tracks vehicles in a video and estimates their speeds using a virtual reference line.

🎯 Project Goal

Developed as a learning project after completing a YOLO course — focusing on understanding object tracking and motion analysis workflows:

Using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model (yolov8n.pt)

Detecting and tracking vehicles in a video

Drawing a reference line to estimate speed

Saving an annotated output video with estimated speeds

🧰 Tools & Technologies

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) — Object Detection

OpenCV — Video Processing & Visualization

Google Colab — Model Execution

Python — Main Programming Language

⚙️ Results & Notes

The displayed speeds are approximate (estimated).

For real-world accuracy, camera calibration and real-distance measurements are required.

This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
